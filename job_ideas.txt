Job Behavior Outline
    Card Swipe Policy
        People often come to Val in groups. Give the system batches of 
        random size (2-10) that show up together and pick the shorter 
        line to wait in together.


    Meal Policy
        Fix Ratings (1-10) for all Non-Entree's and then rate the entree (1-10).
        Give all students some random utility function with meal quality and wait time 
        as inputs and have them try to maximize their utility given the available entree
        and the state of the lines at Val. In this approach, we can use utility as well 
        as other metrics to measure performance.

    Vary this function enough from job to job that people will pick different meals
